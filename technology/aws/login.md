# Getting Started
Access to the AWS account for the lodge should start here: https://ocscouts.awsapps.com/start/
You'll be asked to sign in with your ThundyID account or if you're a part of the Occoneechee Council SSO program, you can use that account by selecting "Continue with Okta".

### Access
In order to obtain access to the AWS account, you must be pre-provisioned by an administrator with the correct accesses. Having a ThundyID alone will not allow you to enter the AWS account.

### Navigation

After logging in, you'll be brought to your AWS dashboard where you can choose which account and at which permission level you'd like to use. Both the council and the lodge accounts are an option. You may not always have access to multiple accounts and multiple permission levels. Once you've decided on which one you want, you can select it and it will launch your normal AWS dashboard.
