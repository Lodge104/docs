# Getting Started
Access to the AWS account for the lodge should start here: https://ocscouts.awsapps.com/start/
You'll be asked to sign in with your ThundyID account or if you're a part of the Occoneechee Council SSO program, you can use that account by selecting "Continue with Okta".

### Access
In order to obtain access to the AWS account, you must be pre-provisioned by an administrator with the correct accesses. Having a ThundyID alone will not allow you to enter the AWS account.
