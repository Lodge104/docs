# Knowledge and Policy Center
> “The knowledge of all things is possible” 
> ― Leonardo da Vinci

### What
The knowledge and policy center is a collaborative space for lodge and chapter leaders to publicize knowledge and lodge policies for the greater good of the lodge. Over years, members within our lodge carve out niche roles for themselves and others to best serve the lodge. While in these roles, processes and general policies are often made but known only by the few who perform and administer them. This website is made to share these processes and policies in an open forum free from any one record keeper. All who have knowledge are invited to share.

### How
This website is open to the entire public. Anyone is free to browse through the collection of articles. If you are listed in LodgeMaster with any position, your Thundy ID account automatically has access to update content. Please login with your account to automatically begin adding content. If you get an error message, please contact the lodge leadership at https://support.lodge104.net/

If you do not have an active position listed within LodgeMaster, you will not be able to login even if you have a Thundy ID.

### When
Start today before your knowledge is lost.
